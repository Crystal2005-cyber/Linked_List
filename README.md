 Linked List
 ____________

 A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a series of connected nodes, each randomly
stored in memory.

Each node contains two parts: a data part(44) and an address part(point to null or next node).

The address part of the last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

In a linked list, each node contains a link to the next node in the sequence.
